    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This broccoli Alfredo pasta is so pretty made with farfalle, also called
      bow-tie pasta. Of course, you may use fettuccine if you prefer. As a main
      dish, this serves 2; as a side, it serves 4. Add a salad, if you wish, and
      some bread. We love it as a side with grilled chicken or shrimp.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Farfalle pasta</b>: 4 ounces of farfalle pasta.</li>
      <li><b>Broccoli</b>: 2 cups of fresh broccoli florets.</li>
      <li><b>Butter</b>: 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter.</li>
      <li><b>Heavy cream</b>: 1/2 cup of heavy cream.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Parmesan cheese</b>: 3/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese (see
        Note).
      </li>
      <li><b>Garlic</b>: 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic.</li>
      <li><b>Nutmeg</b>: 1 pinch of ground nutmeg, or to taste.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Salt and pepper</b>: Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li><b>Parsley</b>: Fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta
        at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
        about 12 minutes. Remove to a colander; reserve the pasta water for
        later use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add broccoli to a microwave-safe container along with 1/4 cup water.
        Cover and cook on High until bright green and tender with a bite, about
        4 minutes. Drain; season with salt. Keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet or saucepan over low heat. Stir in
        cream and allow to simmer, stirring often, for 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cheese and garlic, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted.
        Stir in nutmeg and remove from heat. If the sauce is too thick, stir in
        a bit of reserved pasta water. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, combine cooked pasta, cooked broccoli, and sauce. Garnish with
        fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
